# mistral_codestralapi
This project is a work in progress that provides usage examples for the following:

1. **[Mistral API: Information Extraction with JSON Mode](https://github.com/mmvvff/mistral_codestralapi/blob/main/notebooks/mistral_mixed_analysis.ipynb)**
- We offer a straightforward comparison of the performance of models in the [Mistral family](https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/models/), focusing specifically on extracting information using JSON mode and JSON schemas.
- We draw on the course [Getting Started with Mistral[(https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/getting-started-with-mistral/)

2. **[How to Use Mistral's Codestral API](https://github.com/mmvvff/mistral_codestralapi/blob/main/notebooks/codestral_example.ipynb)**
   - We demonstrate how to integrate the Codestral API into a Python workflow, focusing on the service's FIM (fill in the middle) and chat completion features.
   - For more details, refer to the [Codestral documentation](https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/code_generation/).
