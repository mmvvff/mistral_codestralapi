- Mistral API: Information Extraction with JSON Mode: we offer a straightforward comparison of the performance of models in the [Mistral family](https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/models/), specifically focusing on extracting information using JSON mode.
- How to use Mistral's (Codestral API)[https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/code_generation/]: in this case, we show how to integrate the Codestral API into a Python workflow, focusing specifically on the service's FIM and chat completion features.
