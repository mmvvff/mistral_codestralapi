    "#### 4.2.1. Technical Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "We consistently encountered the following error when trying to parse JSON datasets to the API: `An error occurred: MistralException - Unexpected exception (ReadTimeout)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This error suggests that the API has a timeout limit that is being exceeded when processing datasets (i.e., JSON files with more than one entry). This limitation prevented us from assessing the selected models' performance on multiple records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, it's worth noting that we are using the API through Mistral's free trial, which may have stricter rate limits or timeout thresholds compared to paid tiers, potentially contributing to the challenges we faced in processing datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2.2. Implications and Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "The inability to process large datasets directly through the API has the following implications for our assessment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scale limitations:** Our current analysis is limited to processing of small subset (n=6), which may not fully represent the models' capabilities in handling larger datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these limitations, we will continue to explore alternative batch processing strategies that stay within the API's time constraints.\n",
